# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This project will be for a budgeting application. I feel like the one I currently use (GoodBudget app) doesn't provide enough folders for things I'd like to budget for (you have to pay for additional folders) so I might as well make my own. I would like to incorporate as many different budgeting ideas I have into this app as I work on this project, and see which ones end up viable and which ones do not. Ideally I would reach the point where I actually use this app to budget for a month.
### Features
User Login: A screen where the user logs in
Create Bucket: Users will be able to create a bucket (my take on a folder in the GoodBudget app). A bucket is titled what you are budgeting for, e.g. a Groceries bucket.
Delete Bucket: Users will be able to delete buckets
Add Transaction: Users will be able to add a credit or expense transaction in a bucket.
Transfer: Users will be able to easily transfer money between buckets (not possible as one step in GoodBudget app)
Profile/Settings: Users will be able to update their profile/account settings
"Sub-Buckets" and "Fixed Buckets": I want to come up with more creative names, which will probably mean changing the current name "bucket" later on. Anyway, a "sub-bucket" is just a sub-category, like if you wanted a Food bucket to have the 2 subcategories of Groceries and Going Out. I'm not sure whether having sub-buckets this, or if simply having the user be able to create a lot of buckets, will be better. "Fixed Buckets" refers to fixed costs, like rent, wi-fi, or auto insurance. On something like GoodBudget you wouldn't even put these in; they are fixed costs so you don't have to budget separately for them. However, it would be nice if they could be listed along with the other buckets. A Fixed Bucket would automatically have money allocated to it, and you wouldn't be able to transfer money out of it without deleting the bucket or making it not fixed.
### Technologies
Technologies I currently know well are:
Python
Java
Technologies I know somewhat are:
JavaScript
HTML & CSS
C
R
SQL
### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll have to learn whatever technologies it takes to make a mobile app because I'm not sure. Making a website would be okay too, since I know JavaScript/HTML&CSS, but I would prefer to learn something new and I've never made an app before.
